title: 'How to create a watchlist'
---

Watchlists are a core feature in Nevua Markets that help you **stay updated** on the topics you care about **without having to manually track** Polymarket for new markets.

## Basic search

The process is very simple: you **enter keywords that match your interests**, and our system searches through:

- **Event titles** - the name of each market on Polymarket
- **Category tags** - the tags that Polymarket assigns to each event (e.g., "Politics", "Crypto", "Sports")

For example, if you create a watchlist with the keywords "Middle East", "Israel", and "Iran", you'll see all markets that mention these terms in their title or have related category tags.

## Advanced search

We will soon add advanced search to support more criteria, such as creating watchlists based on trading volume, monitoring the watchlists that top traders follow, and more.

## New and resolved market updates

Watchlists are **automatically updated**:

- When **a new market is created** on Polymarket that matches your keywords, it will **instantly appear in your watchlist**. You don't need to refresh or check back manually; the information comes to you.
- When **an existing market is resolved**, it will be automatically removed from the watchlist.

<Tip>You can see a log of new markets and resolved ones, along with their trend and resolution, by clicking the 'Show Feed' button</Tip>

This means you can **focus on monitoring the signal** (market movements, odds changes) rather than spending time searching for relevant markets.
