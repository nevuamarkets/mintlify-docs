title: 'Create a watchlist'
---

Watchlists are a core feature in Nevua Markets that help you **stay updated** on the topics you care about **without having to manually track** Polymarket for new markets.

## Basic search

The process is very simple: you **enter keywords that match your interests**, and our system searches through:

- **Event titles** - the name of each market on Polymarket
- **Category tags** - the tags that Polymarket assigns to each event (e.g., "Politics", "Crypto", "Sports")

For example, if you create a watchlist with the keywords "Middle East", "Israel", and "Iran", you'll see all markets that mention these terms in their title or have related category tags.

## New and resolved market updates

Watchlists are **automatically updated**:

- When **a new market is created** on Polymarket that matches your keywords or search criteria, it will **instantly appear in your watchlist**. You don't need to refresh or check back manually; new markets come to you.
- When **an existing market is resolved**, it will be **automatically removed** from the watchlist; no need for manual clean up.

<Tip>You can see the **log** of **new markets** and **resolved** ones, along with their **trend and resolution**, by clicking the '**Show Feed**' button</Tip>
