description: How often should your alert trigger?
---

There are two options when selecting trigger frequency: `Once` and `Repeating`.

## Once

Alerts will fire one time and be automatically paused. You can manually restart paused alerts.

<Tip>`Once` alerts are the default option and are generally preferred, because they prevent notification spam.</Tip>

## Repeating

Alerts will continue triggering. The frequency depends on the alert condition type. Some alerts have set frequencies (e.g., one time per five minutes), others provide more flexible frequencies (e.g., fire at 10 minute, 30 minute, 1 hour intervals, etc.).

<Tip>`Repeating` alerts are useful for volatile markets with frequent price movements.</Tip>
