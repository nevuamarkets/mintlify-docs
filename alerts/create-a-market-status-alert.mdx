Every new watchlist you create comes with a market status alert. This is so that all new matching markets created in Polymarket will land into your watchlist automatically.

If you accidentally delete it while managing your alerts, you can simply recreate it:

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsInline
  className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
  src="/alerts/content/create-event-status-alert.mp4"
></video>



<Tip>**Only one** market status alert is allowed per watchlist</Tip>
