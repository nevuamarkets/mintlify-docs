## How to connect your Telegram account

Getting started with Telegram notifications is quick and easy. When creating or editing an alert, simply click the '**Enable Telegram**' button. This will open a Telegram window where you'll need to tap '**Start**' to authorize the connection.

This is a **one-time setup** - once connected, all future alerts can use Telegram notifications:

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsInline
  className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
  src="/alerts/content/telegram-enable-notifications.mp4"
></video>

## Setting up your alerts

Once your Telegram account is connected, you can enable Telegram notifications for any alert by selecting the Telegram option. All notifications will be delivered instantly to your Telegram inbox:

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsInline
  className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
  src="/alerts/content/telegram-notifications.mp4"
></video>
