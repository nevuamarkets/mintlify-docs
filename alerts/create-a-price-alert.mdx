Price alerts help you stay informed about **market movements** without constantly monitoring your watchlists. You can set up alerts that trigger when market prices cross specific thresholds or meet certain conditions.

There are three scopes that you can create alerts for: **watchlist**, **event** and **market**.

### Watchlist Price Alert

<Tip>Watchlist alerts **apply to all existing and any new markets** that will automatically be added if they match your watchlists' search query.</Tip>

In order to create a watchlist alert:

1. **Navigate to the watchlist** you want to create an alert for
2. **Click the "Create Alert"** button in the top action bar

### Event Price Alert

<Tip>Event alerts **apply to all existing and any new markets** that may be added to that particular event.</Tip>

Events are a **group of related markets**. For example, the event '[New York City Mayoral Election](https://polymarket.com/event/new-york-city-mayoral-election?tid=1760108278708)' has separate markets for each candidate.

In order to create an event alert, **click on the bell button on the left of the event title**.

The process is the same as creating an event alert - **click on the bell button on the left of the market title**.
