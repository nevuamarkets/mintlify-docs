title: 'What is Nevua Markets?'
---

- Let the markets read the news for you. Get real time alerts for events that matter.

Nevua Markets is a platform that delivers **real time updates** for topics that matter to you. It does that by leveraging [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com), the world's biggest prediction market.

## Manifesto

Dealing with online information is an impossible task.

- AI-generated content is already advanced enough to make fabricated stories indistinguishable from truth.
- News outlets, big social media accounts and influencers have strong monetary incentives to optimize for engagement. Acquiring and keeping attention does not always align with telling truth, or with reducing unnecessary noise.
- AI-agents are getting better in life-like interactions; it is becoming harder to understand if you are interacting with a real human or a bot.

X (Twitter) is the de facto platform to get real time information and early signals of big things that are about to happen. But the cost of tracking is too high:

## Enter Prediction Markets - Distilled X (Twitter)

Prediction Markets are perhaps our best tool to filter all this noise and get to the actual signal. We chose Polymarket, because it aligns

- By introducing bets and financial rewards, prediction markets are bringing skin in the game and better incentives to be precise in a prediction: people (and soon, AI bots!) that get the news right win real money.
- Therefore, traders have the incentive to get into remarkable lengths to get early signals, analyze them and place their bets.
- Sometimes, people with inside information ('insiders') may want to profit from an upcoming announcement and will place a big bet. Being an open platform, Polymarket allows for these tranactions to be detected, and therefore propagage the signal that perhaps a trend shift is underway.


We cannot predict the future. But a trend shift almost always means that something big has happened.
