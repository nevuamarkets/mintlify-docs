    **[Generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence)** tools are available to everyone and are already advanced enough to fabricate images, videos and stories that are **indistinguishable** from truth. Online discourse is often for any topic is often flooded by automated bot armies that try to steer the conversation one way or the other.

    <Card title="Social media enagagement at all costs">
    News outlets and big social media accounts have strong monetary incentives to **acquire attention** and retain it by **increasing engagement** with their community. This incentive does not always align with sticking to the facts, or with reducing unnecessary noise. On the contrary, **stiring drama**, triggering outrage and sparking conflict happen organically, because they increase engagement.

    <Card title='Information Overload'>
    The information you are looking for is out there. But there are **too many sources to track**, and the only way to be on top of a certain topic is to **consume inordinate amount of data**, or to set up notifications from news outlets, X accounts, or any other information source you trust. The latter can work, but is still not tailored to what you need.

    X (Twitter) is the de facto platform to get real time information and early signals of big things that are about to happen. It works, but the cost of tracking is too high:

## Enter Prediction Markets

**Prediction Markets** are perhaps our best tool to filter all this noise and get to the actual signal. They make it possible to **distill all the information available for a specific topic**, with a very simple method: they allow traders to **bet on their belief of how an event will unfold**. Traders are **rewarded** when they make the correct bets and **take a loss* when events go the other way. 

- By introducing bets and financial rewards, prediction markets are creating [skin in the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game) dynamics and better incentives to be precise in a prediction: people (and soon, AI bots!) that make correct predictions **win real money**.
- Therefore, traders have the incentive to get into remarkable lengths to get early signals, analyze them and place their bets.
- Sometimes, people with inside information ('insiders') may want to profit from an upcoming announcement and will place a big bet. Being an open platform, Polymarket allows for these tranactions to be detected, and therefore propagage the signal that perhaps a trend shift is underway.

## We cannot predict the future but:

- A big trend shift **almost always** means that **something significant happened, or is about to.

For example, see this spike in 2024 presidential election market:
