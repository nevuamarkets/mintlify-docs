     **[Generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence)** tools are available to everyone and are advanced enough to **fabricate** images, videos, and stories that are **indistinguishable** from truth. 
 
     To make things worse, online discourse on any topic is often **flooded by automated [bots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot)** deploying **[computational propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_propaganda)**, using algorithms and automation to manipulate public opinion and steer conversations at scale.

#### Information Overload

        <Card>
            We believe the information needed to understand any topic of interest **is almost always publicly available**. 

            The challenge isn't access to information; it's **filtering through the overwhelming noise and volume of information.**.

    **There are simply too many sources to track**: news outlets, social media accounts, specialized forums, government releases, and independent analysts all publishing constantly. The only way to stay truly informed on a topic is to **consume an inordinate amount of data** every single day.
    
    Dedicated **[Open-Source Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) (OSINT) teams** prove this is possible. They do this grueling work very successfully. For example, the [`OSINTdefender`](https://x.com/sentdefender) account on X has amassed **1.6 million followers** by meticulously tracking and verifying information around geopolitical events.

    But for most individuals, **doing your own comprehensive research is simply too time-consuming**. Combine that with our natural cognitive biases and human reasoning flaws, and you have a recipe for misinformation and incomplete understanding.

#### Social media engagement at all costs

Large social media accounts have strong incentives to **capture and hold attention**, often because **engagement** drives monetary gain. 

Unfortunately, this often does not align with delivering accurate, signal-rich information. Instead, **sensationalism wins**: stirring drama, triggering outrage, and sparking conflict all drive engagement metrics. 

The most viral content is often the most emotionally charged, not the most factual. This creates an environment where **noise drowns out signal**, and **accuracy** takes a back seat to **controversy**.

## Enter Prediction Markets

**Prediction markets** are perhaps our best tool to **filter most of the noise and get to the actual signal.** 

### How they work

<Note>Check [Polymarket's documentation](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/get-started/what-is-polymarket) for a deep-dive explanation</Note>

Prediction markets **distill all available information on a topic** using a very simple method: they allow traders to **bet on their belief of how an event will unfold**. Traders are **rewarded** when they make the correct bets and **take a loss** when events go the other way. 

- By introducing bets and financial rewards, prediction markets create [skin in the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game) dynamics and better incentives to be precise in predictions: people (and soon, AI bots!) that make correct predictions **win real money**.
- Therefore, traders have the incentive to go to **[remarkable lengths](https://x.com/EasyEatsBodega/status/1975346341942276288)** to get an information edge and place their bets.
- In markets where this applies, people with **inside information** may want to profit from an upcoming event and may place large bets. Being an open platform, Polymarket **allows these transactions to be detected**, and therefore **propagate the signal that a trend shift may be underway**.

<Tip>**Nevua Markets** makes these real-time shifts accessible and understandable, so anyone can spot the signal **before it hits mainstream news.**</Tip>

### Other platforms ([Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/), [Limitless](https://limitless.exchange/), etc.)

There are many prediction market platforms. We focus on Polymarket because we believe that:

- [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) will continue being the world's biggest prediction market
- Hundreds of thousands of markets for regional and smaller events will eventually be running on Polymarket
- As more and more advanced traders enter the prediction market floor (quants, high-frequency trading, etc.), arbitrage between markets is going to be eliminated. The result will be actual market efficiency; **similar markets will have almost the same odds across platforms**

## We canâ€™t predict the future with certainty, but

- A big trend shift **almost always** means that **something significant just happened**, or is about to happen.
- Market dynamics created by opposing traders provide very strong crowdsourced data for **the current consensus of an event**. When new information is available, traders will be the first to know, place their bets, and therefore change the odds of an event.
- **We believe that every topic worth discussing in politics, culture, etc. will be tracked on prediction markets**.

<Tip>**Nevua Markets exists to help you see the world as it unfolds, through the collective intelligence of the market.**</Tip>
