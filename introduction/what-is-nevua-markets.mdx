title: 'What is Nevua Markets?'

Nevua Markets is a platform that delivers **real-time updates** for topics that matter to you. It does this by leveraging [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com), the world's biggest prediction market.

## Navigating online media has become an impossible task

    <Accordion defaultOpen='true' title='Information Overload'>
    We believe that the information you need to understand any topic of interest **is almost always publicly available**. The challenge isn't access to information; it's **filtering through the overwhelming volume of sources**.

    **There are simply too many sources to track**: news outlets, social media accounts, specialized forums, government releases, and independent analysts all publishing constantly. The only way to stay truly informed on a topic is to **consume an inordinate amount of data** every single day.
    
    Dedicated **[Open-Source Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) (OSINT) teams** prove this is possible. They do this grueling work very successfully. For example, the [`OSINTdefender`](https://x.com/sentdefender) account on X has amassed **1.6 million followers** by meticulously tracking and verifying information around geopolitical events.

    But for most individuals, **doing your own comprehensive research is simply too time-consuming**. Add to this the fact that we all suffer from cognitive biases and human reasoning flaws, and you have a recipe for misinformation and incomplete understanding.

    **[Generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence)** tools are available to everyone and are already advanced enough to **fabricate** images, videos, and stories that are **indistinguishable** from truth. To make things worse, online discourse on any topic is often **flooded by automated bot armies** that try to steer the conversation one way or the other.

    <Accordion defaultOpen='true' title="Social media engagement at all costs">
    News outlets and major social media accounts have strong monetary incentives to **capture and retain attention** through maximum engagement. Unfortunately, this often does not align with delivering accurate, signal-rich information. 
    
    Instead, **sensationalism wins**: stirring drama, triggering outrage, and sparking conflict all drive engagement metrics. The most viral content is often the most emotionally charged, not the most factual. This creates an environment where noise drowns out signal, and accuracy takes a back seat to controversy.

    <Columns cols={2}>

    **X (Twitter) is the de facto platform to get real-time news and early signals for big things that are about to happen**. You can tailor your feed and create lists of accounts per topic, but the cost of tracking is too high:

## Enter Prediction Markets

**Prediction markets are perhaps our best tool to filter most of the noise and get to the actual signal.** 

<Note>Check [Polymarket's documentation](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/get-started/what-is-polymarket) for a deep-dive explanation of how it works</Note>

They make it possible to **distill all the information available for a specific topic** by using a very simple method: they allow traders to **bet on their belief of how an event will unfold**. Traders are **rewarded** when they make the correct bets and **take a loss** when events go the other way. 

- By introducing bets and financial rewards, prediction markets create [skin in the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game) dynamics and better incentives to be precise in predictions: people (and soon, AI bots!) that make correct predictions **win real money**.
- Therefore, traders have the incentive to go to **[remarkable lengths](https://x.com/EasyEatsBodega/status/1975346341942276288)** to get an information edge and place their bets.
- In markets where this applies, people with **inside information** may want to profit from an upcoming event and will place a big bet. Being an open platform, Polymarket **allows these transactions to be detected**, and therefore **propagate the signal that a trend shift may be underway**.

### Why don't you track other prediction market platforms ([Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/), [Limitless](https://limitless.exchange/), etc.)?

We believe that: 

- [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) will continue being the world's biggest prediction market
- Hundreds of thousands of markets for regional and smaller events will eventually be running on Polymarket
- As more and more advanced traders enter the prediction market floor (quants, high-frequency trading, etc.), arbitrage between markets is going to be eliminated. The result will be actual market efficiency; **similar markets will have almost the same odds across platforms**

## In closing, we cannot predict the future, but:

- A big trend shift **almost always** means that **something significant just happened**, or is about to happen.
- Market dynamics created by opposing traders provide very strong crowdsourced data for **the current consensus of an event**. When new information is available, traders will be the first to know, place their bets, and therefore change the odds of an event.
- **We believe that every topic worth discussing in politics, culture, etc. will be tracked on prediction markets**.
