This document describes the webhook notification schemas that are sent when subscription alerts are triggered for the `/subscriptions` endpoint.

## Overview

When you create a subscription with webhook channels configured, Nevua Markets will send HTTP POST requests to your configured webhook URLs when the subscription conditions are met. There are two types of notifications:

1. **Price Notifications** - Sent when price-based alert conditions are met (e.g., crossing thresholds)
2. **Event Status Notifications** - Sent when event or market status changes occur (e.g., new events created, markets closed)

## Price Notification Schema

This schema is used for all price-based alert notifications.

## Webhook Delivery

### HTTP Request Format

All webhook notifications are delivered as HTTP POST requests with the following characteristics:

- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **User-Agent**: `Polyterminal-Webhook/1.0`
- **Body**: JSON payload matching one of the schemas above

### Response Requirements

Your webhook endpoint should:
- Respond with a 2xx HTTP status code to indicate successful receipt
- Respond within 30 seconds to avoid timeout
- Handle duplicate notifications gracefully (notifications may be retried)

### Retry Policy

Failed webhook deliveries will be retried with exponential backoff:
- Initial retry: 1 minute
- Subsequent retries: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 minutes
- Maximum retries: 5 attempts
- Total retry window: ~1 hour

### Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS endpoints for webhook URLs
- Implement signature verification if needed (contact support for details)
- Validate the notification structure before processing
- Consider implementing idempotency based on `subscriptionId` + `detectedAtMs`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing notifications**: Check that your webhook URL is accessible and responding with 2xx status codes
2. **Duplicate notifications**: Implement idempotency handling based on notification IDs
3. **Timeout errors**: Ensure your webhook endpoint responds within 30 seconds

### Testing Your Webhook

You can test your webhook endpoint by creating a test subscription and triggering conditions manually, or by using tools like ngrok for local development.
