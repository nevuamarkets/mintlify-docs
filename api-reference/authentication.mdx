## Bearer Token Authentication

For endpoints that require authentication, you must include a Bearer token in the Authorization header. This token identifies your account and provides access to your data.

### How to Authenticate

Include your API token in the `Authorization` header of every request using the Bearer authentication scheme:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/subscriptions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_token_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Getting Your API Token

TBD

<Warning>
Keep your API token secure! Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories. Store it as an environment variable or in a secure configuration file.
</Warning>

### Authentication Errors

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response with details about the authentication error. Common causes include:

- Missing Authorization header
- Invalid or expired token
- Malformed Bearer token format
